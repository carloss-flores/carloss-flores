### HELLO EVERYONE! ðŸ¦¦

Iâ€™m **Carlos Flores**, a software engineer from Francisco MorazÃ¡n, Honduras.

Iâ€™m currently focused on full-stack development and eager to dive into AI development. Right now, Iâ€™m working on a library management system for the physics faculty, which has been an exciting challenge.

Iâ€™m passionate about software development and the endless possibilities it offers to create innovative solutions from anywhere. Iâ€™m open to internships opportunities, so feel free to reach out!
